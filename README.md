# Lab Site Generator (LSG)

The **Lab Site Generator (LSG)** is a user-friendly platform designed to help academic research labs quickly build and maintain professional, self-updating websites—without requiring any technical knowledge.

## 🌟 Overview

Research labs often lack the time or resources to create and maintain a website. LSG solves this by offering:
- Predefined templates tailored for labs
- Automated integration of publication data (e.g., via Google Scholar)
- Decentralized content management by lab members
- A component-based system with optional manual editing

- **Google Login Support**  
  Secure authentication via Google OAuth2.
