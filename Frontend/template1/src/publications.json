        "description": "Recent years have shown a large increase in applications and research of problems that include moving a fleet of physical robots. One particular application that is currently a multi-billion industry led by tech giants such as Amazon robotics and Alibaba is warehouse robots. In this application, a large number of robots operate autonomously in the warehouse picking up, carrying, and putting down the inventory pods. In this paper, we outline several key research challenges and opportunities that manifest in this warehouse application. The first challenge, known as the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem, is the problem of finding a non-colliding path for each agent. While this problem has been well-studied in recent years, we outline several open questions, including understanding the actual hardness of the problem, learning the warehouse to improve online computations, and distributing the problem. The second challenge is known as the Multi-Agent Package and Delivery (MAPD) problem, which is the problem of moving packages in the warehouse. This problem has received some attention, but with limited theoretical understanding or exploitation of the incoming stream of requests. Finally, we highlight a third, often overlooked challenge, which is the challenge of designing the warehouse in a way that will allow efficient solutions of the two above challenges.",

        "description": "Multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) is the problem of finding a plan for moving a set of agents from their initial locations to their goals without collisions. Following this plan, however, may not be possible due to unexpected events that delay some of the agents. In this work, we propose a holistic solution for MAPF that is robust to such unexpected delays. First, we introduce the notion of a k-robust MAPF plan, which is a plan that can be executed even if a limited number (k) of delays occur. We propose sufficient and required conditions for finding a k-robust plan, and show how to convert several MAPF solvers to find such plans. Then, we propose several robust execution policies. An execution policy is a policy for agents executing a MAPF plan. An execution policy is robust if following it guarantees that the agents reach their goals even if they encounter unexpected delays. Several classes of such robust execution policies are proposed and evaluated experimentally. Finally, we present robust execution policies for cases where communication between the agents may also be delayed. We performed an extensive experimental evaluation in which we compared different algorithms for finding robust MAPF plans, compared different ro-bust execution policies, and studied the interplay between having a robust plan and the performance when using a robust execution policy.",

We propose two methods for verifying that given solutions are p-robust.

        "description": "The challenge of finding an optimal solution to a multi-agent path finding (MAPF) problem has attracted significant academic and industrial interest in recent years. While the problem is NP-Hard, modern optimal MAPF algorithms can scale to solve problems with hundreds of agents. Nevertheless, no single optimal MAPF algorithm dominates all benchmarks problems, and there are no clear, provable, guidelines for when each algorithm should be used. To address this, we present the first successful Algorithm Selection (AS) model for optimal MAPF. We propose two approaches for learning an AS model. The first approach uses a standard supervised learning algorithm with a set of handcrafted MAPF-specific features. The second approach, casts a MAPF problem to an image and applies a deep Convolutional Neural Network to classify it. We evaluate both approaches over a large dataset and show that using an AS model to select which algorithm to use for each instance results in solving more problems and in a shorter runtime compared to the state of the art.",

Our Bidding-in-Spades (BIS) algorithm heuristically determines the bidding strategy by comparing the expected utility of each possible bid. A major challenge is how to estimate these expected utilities.

However, most troubleshooting algorithms proposed to date do not consider the option of performing  batch repair actions . In this work we close this gap, and address the combinatorial problem of choosing which batch repair action to perform so as to minimize the overall repair costs. We call this problem the  Batch Repair Problem  (BRP) and formalize it. Then, we propose several approaches for solving it.

Continuous-time CBS (CCBS) is a recently proposed version of CBS that guarantees optimal solutions without the need to discretize time. However, the scalability of CCBS is limited because it does not include any known improvements of CBS. In this paper, we begin to close this gap and explore how to adapt successful CBS improvements, namely, prioritizing conflicts (PC), disjoint splitting (DS), and high-level heuristics, to the continuous time setting of CCBS. These adaptions are not trivial, and require careful handling of different types of constraints, applying a generalized version of the Safe interval path planning (SIPP) algorithm, and extending the notion of cardinal conflicts. We evaluate the effect of the suggested enhancements by running experiments both on general graphs and 2^ k-neighborhood grids. CCBS with these improvements significantly outperforms vanilla CCBS, solving problems with almost twice as many agents in some cases and pushing the limits of multi-agent path finding in continuous-time domains.",

        "description": "Creating a domain model, even for classical, domain-independent planning, is a notoriously hard knowledge-engineering task. A natural approach to solve this problem is to learn a domain model from observations. However, model learning approaches frequently do not provide safety guarantees: the learned model may assume actions are applicable when they are not, and may incorrectly capture actions' effects. This may result in generating plans that will fail when executed. In some domains such failures are not acceptable, due to the cost of failure or inability to replan online after failure. In such settings, all learning must be done offline, based on some observations collected, e.g., by some other agents or a human. Through this learning, the task is to generate a plan that is guaranteed to be successful. This is called the model-free planning problem. Prior work proposed an algorithm for solving the model-free planning problem in classical planning. However, they were limited to learning grounded domains, and thus they could not scale. We generalize this prior work and propose the first safe model-free planning algorithm for lifted domains. We prove the correctness of our approach, and provide a statistical analysis showing that the number of trajectories needed to solve future problems with high probability is linear in the potential size of the domain model. We also present experiments on twelve IPC domains showing that our approach is able to learn the real action model in all cases with at most two trajectories.",

        "description": "In many real-world scenarios, the time it takes for a mobile agent, eg, a robot, to move from one location to another may vary due to exogenous events and be difficult to predict accurately. Planning in such scenarios is challenging, especially in the context of Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF), where the goal is to find paths to multiple agents and temporal coordination is necessary to avoid collisions. In this work, we consider a MAPF problem with this form of time uncertainty, where we are only given upper and lower bounds on the time it takes each agent to move. The objective is to find a safe solution, which is a solution that can be executed by all agents and is guaranteed to avoid collisions. We propose two complete and optimal algorithms for finding safe solutions based on well-known MAPF algorithms, namely, A* with Operator Decomposition (A*+ OD) and Conflict-Based Search (CBS). Experimentally, we observe that on several standard MAPF grids the CBS-based algorithm performs better. We also explore the option of online replanning in this context, ie, modifying the agents' plans during execution, to reduce the overall execution cost. We consider two online settings:(a) when an agent can sense the current time and its current location, and (b) when the agents can also communicate seamlessly during execution. For each setting, we propose a replanning algorithm and analyze its behavior theoretically and empirically. Our experimental evaluation confirms that indeed online replanning in both settings can significantly reduce solution cost.",

To facilitate comparison between these algorithms, a benchmark of MAPF problems was recently proposed. We report a comprehensive evaluation of a diverse set of state-of-the-art optimal MAPF algorithms over the entire benchmark. The results show that in terms of coverage, the recently proposed LazyCBS algorithm outperforms all others significantly, but it is usually not the fastest algorithm. This suggests algorithm selection methods can be beneficial. Then, we characterize different setups for algorithm selection in MAPF, and evaluate simple baselines for each setup.

        "description": "Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) is a well-known approach to diagnosis in medical domains. In this approach, the behavior of a system is modeled and used to identify faulty components, i.e., once a symptom of abnormal behavior is observed, an inference algorithm is run on the system model and returns possible explanations. Such explanations are referred to as diagnoses. A diagnosis is an assumption about which set of components are faulty and have caused the abnormal behavior. In this work, we focus on the case where multiple observations are available to the diagnoser, collected at different times, such that some of these observations exhibit symptoms of abnormal behavior. MBD with multiple observations is challenging because some components may fail intermittently, i.e., behave abnormally in one observation and behave normally in another, while other components may fail all the time (non-intermittently). Inspired by recent success in solving classical diagnosis problems using Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers, we describe two SAT-based approaches to solve this MBD with multiple observations problem. The first approach compiles the problem to a single SAT formula, and the second approach solves each observation independently and then merges them together. We compare these two approaches experimentally on a standard diagnosis benchmark and analyze their pros and cons.",

To identify which components are more likely to contain bugs, we train a software fault prediction model using machine learning techniques.

        "description": "Path Finding (PF) is the problem of finding a path for an agent on a given graph. Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) extends PF to the case of multiple agents. In MAPF, a path for each agent is needed (a plan) such that the agents do not conflict, eg, two or more agents cannot be located at the same location at the same time. Finding the lowest cost solution (optimal solution) for MAPF is NP-hard. However, some algorithms are capable of solving MAPF optimally for many agents. One such notable algorithm is the Conflict-Based Search algorithm (CBS). MAPF has many real-life applications, including robotics, traffic control, digital entertainment, and video games. This thesis extends MAPF and explores different forms of optimality in multi-agent problems. It is divided into three parts, all related to MAPF. The first part of this thesis (Chapter 2) examines robust solutions for MAPF. That is, a holistic solution for MAPF that is robust to unexpected delays. First, the notion of a k-robust MAPF plan is introduced, which is a plan that can be executed even if a limited number (k) of delays for each agent occur. We show how to convert several MAPF solvers, including CBS, to find such plans. Then, we propose several robust execution policies for agents executing a MAPF plan. Following such a policy guarantees that the agents reach their goals even if they encounter unexpected delays. We also present robust execution policies for cases where communication between the agents may also be delayed. Finally, we study the problem of finding a p-robust solution to MAPF, which is a solution that succeeds with probability at least p, even though unlimited unexpected\u00a0\u2026",

During planning, agents often reveal the private dependencies between their public actions to other agents, that is, which public action facilitates the preconditions of another public action. Previous work in CPPP does not limit the disclosure of such dependencies. In this paper, we explicitly limit the amount of disclosed dependencies, allowing agents to publish only a part of their private dependencies. We investigate different strategies for deciding which dependencies to publish, and how they affect the ability to find solutions. We evaluate the ability of two solvers -- distribute forward search and centralized planning based on a single-agent projection -- to produce plans under this constraint. Experiments over standard CPPP domains show that the proposed dependency-sharing strategies enable generating plans while sharing only a small fraction of all private dependencies.",

In our research we focus on creating an Anomaly detection models for system logs. The task of anomaly detection is identifying unexpected events in dataset, which differ from the normal behavior. Anomaly detection models also assist in data systems analysis tasks. Modern systems may produce such a large amount of events monitoring every individual event is not feasible. In such cases, the events are often aggregated over a fixed period of time, reporting the number of times every event has occurred in that time period. This aggregation facilitates scaling, but requires a different approach for anomaly detection. In this research, we present a thorough analysis of the aggregated data and the relationships between aggregated events. Based on the initial phase of our research we present graphs representations of our aggregated dataset, which represent the different relationships between aggregated instances in the same context. Using the graph representation, we propose Multiple-graphs autoencoder MGAE, a novel convolutional graphs-autoencoder model which exploits the relationships of the aggregated instances in our unique dataset. MGAE outperforms standard graph-autoencoder models and the different experiments.

To this end, we introduce a variant of PPDDL in which there is uncertainty about the transition probabilities, specified by an interval for each factor that contains the respective true transition probabilities. Then, we present SAM+, an algorithm that learns such an imprecise-PPDDL environment model. SAM+ has a polynomial time and sample complexity, and guarantees that with high probability, the true environment is indeed captured by the defined intervals.

The objective is to create a joint policy for all agents that minimize the expected sum of costs of getting all agents to their goals, while guaranteeing that collisions never occur. Unlike previous work on multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF), the stochastic outcomes are not limited to delays, and thus the set of locations each agent may end up at can be very large. Consequently, offline planning is prohibitively expensive since collisions between agents may occur in many locations and time steps, while avoiding them is a hard constraint. Instead, we propose a suboptimal online approach in which each agent follows its individually-optimal policy until it detected potential collisions in the future. Then, the potentially conflicting agents create a joint policy for resolving the potential collision. We evaluated this policy experimentally on existing an MAPF benchmark, modified to include stochasticity. The results show that we are able to find high quality solutions for non-trivial grids with up to 12 agents, significantly surpassing several baseline approaches.",

To date,  cppp  has focused on domains with deterministic action effects. However, in real-world problems action effects are often non-deterministic, and actions can have multiple possible effects with varying probabilities. In this paper, we introduce Stochastic  cppp  ( scppp ), which is an extension of  cppp  to domains with stochastic action effects. We show how  scppp  can be modeled as a Markov decision process ( mdp ) and how the  value-iteration  algorithm can be adapted to solve it.

        "description": "In the multi-agent path finding problem (MAPF) we are given a set of agents each with respective start and goal positions. The task is to find paths for all agents while avoiding collisions, aiming to minimize a given objective function. Many MAPF solvers were introduced in the past decade for optimizing two specific objective functions: sum-of-costs and makespan. Two prominent categories of solvers can be distinguished: search-based solvers and compilation-based solvers. Search-based solvers were developed and tested for the sum-of-costs objective, while the most prominent compilation-based solvers that are built around Boolean satisfiability (SAT) were designed for the makespan objective. Very little is known on the performance and relevance of solvers from the compilation-based approach on the sum-of-costs objective. In this paper, we start to close the gap between these cost functions in the compilation-based approach. Our main contribution is a new SAT-based MAPF solver called MDD-SAT, that is directly aimed to optimally solve the MAPF problem under the sum-of-costs objective function. Using both a lower bound on the sum-of-costs and an upper bound on the makespan, MDD-SAT is able to generate a reasonable number of Boolean variables in our SAT encoding. We then further improve the encoding by borrowing ideas from ICTS, a search-based solver. In addition, we show that concepts applicable in search-based solvers like ICTS and ICBS are applicable in the SAT-based approach as well. Specifically, we integrate independence detection, a generic technique for decomposing an MAPF instance into independent\u00a0\u2026",

We explore a variant of the PE problem called PE with Fixed Evader plans (PE-FEP), in which an external opponent modeling tool provides a distribution over the plans the Evader agent may select. This PE variant, which is motivated by real-life problems, is particularly challenging for existing PE algorithms when the agents operate in a large-scale 3D grid. In this paper, we explore how techniques from the automated planning literature can be adapted and extended to effectively solve PE-FEP. We propose three ways to model PE-FEP as a Markov Decision Process (MDP): two modeling that approximate the problem and one that fully describes the problem. To solve this large MDP, we employ the well-known Real-Time Dynamic Programming (RTDP) algorithm and develop heuristics to initialize it for each of our MDP modeling scheme. Then, we propose novel techniques for automatically generating abstract, higher-level, actions and show how to use it inside the RTDP framework. Experimental results on large grids with up to 3\u00b7 106 cells, and with sets of up to 30 possible Evader plans, show that our algorithms can scale gracefully with the size of the grid and number of Evader plans.",

Since solving MAPF optimally is NP-hard, researchers have explored algorithms that solve MAPF suboptimally but efficiently. Priority-Based Search (PBS) is the leading algorithm for this purpose. It finds paths for individual agents, one at a time, and resolves collisions by assigning priorities to the colliding agents and replanning their paths during its search. However, PBS becomes ineffective for MAPF instances with high densities of agents and obstacles. Therefore, we introduce Greedy PBS (GPBS), which uses greedy strategies to speed up PBS by minimizing the number of collisions between agents. We then propose techniques that speed up GPBS further, namely partial expansions, target reasoning, induced constraints, and soft restarts. We show that GPBS with all these improvements has a higher success rate than the state-of-the-art suboptimal algorithm for a 1-minute runtime limit, especially for MAPF instances with small maps and dense obstacles.",

        "description": "In multi-agent path finding (MAPF), several agents must move from their current positions to their target positions without colliding. Prior work on MAPF commonly assumed perfect knowledge of the environment. We consider a MAPF setting where this is not the case, and the planner does not know a-priori whether some positions are blocked or not. To sense whether such a position is traversable, an agent must move close to it and adapt its behavior accordingly. In this work we focus on solving this type of MAPF problem, for cases where planning is centralized but cannot be done during execution. In this setting, a solution can be formulated as a plan tree for each agent, branching on the observations. We propose algorithms for finding such plans trees for two modes of executions: centralized, where the agents share information concerning observed obstacles during execution, a decentralized, where such communication is not allowed. The proposed algorithms are complete and can be configured to optimize solution cost, measured for either the best case or the worst case. We implemented these algorithms and provide experimental results demonstrating how our approach scales with respect to the number of agents and the number of positions we are uncertain about. The results show that our algorithms can solve non-trivial problems, but also highlight that this type of MAPF problems is significantly harder than classical MAPF.",

It prioritizes the agents and then repeatedly invokes a single-agent pathfinding algorithm for each agent such that it avoids the paths of higher-priority agents. Performance of prioritized planning depends critically on cleverly ordering the agents. Such an ordering is provided by a priority function. Recent work successfully used machine learning to automatically produce such a priority function given good orderings as the training data. In this paper we explore a different technique for synthesizing priority functions, namely program synthesis in the space of arithmetic formulae. We synthesize priority functions expressed as arithmetic formulae over a set of meaningful problem features via a genetic search in the space induced by a context-free grammar. Furthermore we regularize the fitness function by formula length to synthesize short, human-readable formulae. Such readability is an advantage over previous numeric machine-learning methods and may help explain the importance of features and how to combine them into a good priority function for a given domain. Moreover, our experimental results show that our formula-based priority functions outperform existing machine-learning methods on the standard benchmarks in terms of success rate, run time and solution quality without using more training data.",

Therefore, many MAPF sub-problems must be solved over time in order to solve a single LMAPF problem. LMAPF problems manifest in real-world applications, such as automated warehouses, where strict responsiveness requirements limit the amount of time allocated to planning. MAPF algorithms occasionally fail to produce a plan within the allotted time. We propose a system design for LMAPF that is robust to such planning failures. Then, we explore different approaches to avoid planning failures, reduce their severity, and handle them when they occur. In particular, we describe and analyze different Fail Policies that are applied when planning failures occur and ensure collisions and unnecessary degradation of throughput are avoided.

Numeric Safe Action Models Learning (N-SAM) is a recently proposed algorithm that addresses this challenge. It is an algorithm designed to learn the preconditions and effects of actions from observations in domains that may involve both discrete and continuous state variables. N-SAM has several attractive properties. It runs in polynomial time and is guaranteed to output an action model that is safe, in the sense that plans generated by it are applicable and will achieve their intended goals. To preserve this safety guarantee, N-SAM must observe a substantial number of examples for each action before it is included in the learned action model. We address this limitation of N-SAM and propose N-SAM*, an enhanced version of N-SAM that always returns an action model where every observed action is applicable at least in some state, even if it was only observed once. N-SAM* does so without compromising the safety of the returned action model. We prove that N-SAM* is optimal in terms of sample complexity compared to any other algorithm that guarantees safety.

        "description": "Minecraft is a sandbox game that offers a rich and complex environment for AI research.  Its design allows defining diverse tasks and challenges for AI agents, such as gathering resources and crafting items.  Previous works have applied both Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Automated Planning methods to accomplish different tasks in Minecraft.  RL methods usually require a large number of interactions with the environment, while planning methods requires a model of the domain to be available. Creating planning domain models for Minecraft tasks is arduous.  Algorithms for learning a domain model from observations exist, yet have mostly been used on planning benchmarks.  In this work, we explore the use of such algorithms for solving Minecraft tasks.  We focus on the task of crafting a wooden pogo stick and explore different ways to represent states in this domain. Then, propose an agent that learns domain models from observations --- either generated by an expert or collected online --- and uses them with an off-the-shelf domain-independent planner.",

This is known as any-angle pathfinding. We present the first optimal any-angle multi-agent pathfinding algorithm. Our planner is based on the Continuous Conflict-based Search (CCBS) algorithm and an optimal any-angle variant of the Safe Interval Path Planning (TO-AA-SIPP). The straightforward combination of those, however, scales poorly. To mitigate this, we adapt two techniques from classical MAPF to the any-angle setting, namely Disjoint Splitting and Multi-Constraints. Experimental results on different combinations of these techniques show they enable solving over 30% more problems than the vanilla combination of CCBS and TO-AA-SIPP.

        "description": "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) deals with finding conflict-free paths for a set of agents from an initial configuration to a given target configuration. The Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) problem is a well-studied online version of MAPF in which an agent receives a new target when it reaches its current target. The common approach for solving LMAPF is to treat it as a sequence of MAPF problems, periodically replanning from the agents' current configurations to their current targets. A significant drawback in this approach is that in MAPF the agents must reach a configuration in which all agents are at their targets simultaneously, which is needlessly restrictive for LMAPF. Techniques have been proposed to indirectly mitigate this drawback. We describe cases where these mitigation techniques fail. As an alternative, we propose to solve LMAPF problems by solving a sequence of modified MAPF problems, in which the objective is for each agent to eventually visit its target, but not necessarily for all agents to do so simultaneously. We refer to this MAPF variant as Transient MAPF (TMAPF) and propose several algorithms for solving it based on existing MAPF algorithms. A limited experimental evaluation identifies some cases where using a TMAPF algorithm instead of a MAPF algorithm with an LMAPF framework can improve the system throughput significantly.",

Agents can verify the existence or non-existence of an edge only by moving close to it. To navigate such maps, we propose an online approach where planning and execution are interleaved. As agents gather new information about the environment over time, they replan accordingly. To minimize replanning efforts, we developed methods to identify and replan only for agents affected by observed changes.

This problem manifests in numerous real-world applications such as controlling transportation robots in automated warehouses, moving characters in video games, and coordinating self-driving cars in intersections. Finding optimal solutions to MAPF is NP-Hard, yet modern optimal solvers can scale to hundreds of agents and even thousands in some cases. Different solvers employ different approaches, and there is no single state-of-the-art approach for all problems. Furthermore, there are no clear, provable, guidelines for choosing when each optimal MAPF solver to use. Prior work employed Algorithm Selection (AS) techniques to learn such guidelines from past data. A major challenge when employing AS for choosing an optimal MAPF algorithm is how to encode the given MAPF problem. Prior work either used hand-crafted features or an image representation of the problem. We explore graph-based encodings of the MAPF problem and show how they can be used on-the-fly with a modern graph embedding algorithm called FEATHER. Then, we show how this encoding can be effectively joined with existing encodings, resulting in a novel AS method we call MAPF Algorithm selection via Graph embedding (MAG).

However, faults can sometimes arise during policy execution due to internal faults in the agent. As a result, actions may have unexpected effects. In this work, we aim to diagnose such faults and infer their root cause. We consider two types of diagnosis problems. In the first, which we call RLDXw, we assume we only know what a normal execution looks like. In the second, called RLDXs, we assume we have models for the faulty behavior of a component, which we call fault modes. The solution to RLDXw is a time step at which a fault occurred for the first time. The solution to RLDXs is more informative, represented as a fault mode according to which the RL task was executed. Solving those problems is useful in practice to facilitate efficient repair of faulty agents, since it can focus the repair efforts on specific actions. We formally define RLDXw and RLDXs and design two algorithms called WFMa and SFMa for solving them. We evaluate our algorithms on a benchmark of RL domains and discuss their strengths and limitations. When the number of the observed states increases, both WFMa and SFMa report a decrease in runtime (up to significantly 6.5 times faster). Additionally, the runtime of SFMa increases linearly with the increase in candidate fault modes.",

One such challenge is diagnosing failed multi-agent plan executions, sometimes in system setups where the different agents are not willing to disclose their private actions.

While there have been approaches for delivering as robust plans as possible, we focus on the plan execution stage. Specifically, we address the problem of diagnosing plans that failed their execution. We propose a Model-Based Diagnosis approach to solve this problem. Given an MA-STRIPS problem, a plan that solves it, and an observation that indicates execution failure, we define the MA-STRIPS diagnosis problem. We compile that problem into a boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) and then use an off-the-shelf SAT solver to obtain candidate diagnoses. We further expand this approach to address privacy by proposing a distributed algorithm that can find these same diagnoses in a decentralized manner. Additionally, we propose an enhancement to the distributed algorithm that uses information generated during the diagnosis process to provide significant speedups. We found that the improved algorithm runs more than 10 times faster than the basic decentralized version and, in one case, runs faster than the centralized algorithm.",
